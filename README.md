This is an app that I worked on to explore the following:
1) Location frameworks such as MapKit, CoreLocation and GoogleMaps 
2) Searching within Apple's map
3) Networking by using AlamoFire to hit meetup.com API

In this app a user can search for a place, and see driving directions in either AppleMap or GoogleMap. Secondly, the user can also see meetups happening within 25 mile radius of his/her current location.

Pending Tasks:
1) Beautification of the app
2) Adding a spinner to show the loading process
3) Opening a particular meetup within the app in Safari
